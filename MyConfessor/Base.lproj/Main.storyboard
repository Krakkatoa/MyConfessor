As a priest, you can use MyConfessor to publish the fact that you are ready to hear confessions.

As a penitent, you can search for priests who are currently in the confessional or are willing to hear confessions outside normally scheduled hours.

We know this is a unique idea, and we're pretty sure you've got some questions, so check out our FAQ section below, or email our developer at info@carmelheart.com.

Frequently Asked Questions

Q: How can MyConfessor be used now? 

A: MyConfessor is currently designed for use by parishioners of Father Richard Heilman, in Pine Bluff, Wisconsin. We hope that priests in other areas will want to make themselves available for confession at other times outside their usual schedule. We hope you will also choose to make this app a tool for encouraging more parishioners to confess more often.  

Q: How will I eventually be able to use MyConfessor?

A: Eventually, you will be able to go to the home tab and use the search box to search all priests in the area to find a priest by name, parish, city, diocese or zip code.

Q: Is any information I submit confidential and anonymous?

A: MyConfessor is completely confidential and anonymous for penitents (that's you!)

Q: I'm a priest. How do I get on board?

A: Great! Please email us of your interest, and when we enable the account request feature, we'll notify you. (developer's email: info@carmelheart.com)

Q. How can I donate to help your cause become more successful?

A: We are accepting PayPal contributions from this webpage:

                                <mutableString key="text">Having entered the confessional, place yourself in the presence of God, Who sees all things, and then address His minister:

“Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.
I confess to almighty God, and to you, Father, that I have sinned exceedingly in thought, word, deed, and omission, through my fault.

It has been ____ weeks since my last confession. I accuse myself of having committed, during that time, the following sins...”

State your sins, followed by:

“For these, and all the sins of which I have at any time been guilty, I humbly ask pardon of God, and absolution of you, Father, if you think me worthy.”

Listen intently to anything the confessor may choose to say; humbly accept the penance he imposes, and, once he has completed the prayer of absolution, recite the act of contrition. However, the priest may ask you to pray the Act of Contrition prior to offering his prayer of absolution.

The Act of Contrition

“O My God, I am heartily sorry for having offended Thee and I detest all my sins because I dread the loss of heaven and the pains of hell, but most of all because they offend Thee, my God, Who art all good and deserving of all my love. I firmly resolve, with the help of Thy grace, to sin no more and avoid the near occasions of sin. Amen.”

After confession, we should return thanks to God for His mercies in forgiving our sins, beg that He supply whatever has been wanting in us and bless our good resolutions, and immediately thereafter say our penance.

We use an examination of conscience to help call to mind our sins and failings during a period of quiet reflection before approaching the priest in Confession. It’s important for a good Catholic examination of conscience to be thorough. This will help you learn about sins that you may not be aware of. It’s also a chance to develop your conscience.
Set aside some quiet time for your reflection.'

Start by praying to the Holy Spirit, asking for help in making a good examination to prepare for Confession. Use the Ten Commandments to guide your examination. If necessary, take this list or some brief notes (keep them private!) to Confession to help you remember your sins.

First Commandment

I am the Lord your God. You shall worship the Lord your God and Him only shall you serve.

Have I …

*Disobeyed the commandments of God or the Church?
*Refused to accept what God has revealed as true, or what the Catholic Church proposes for belief?
*Denied the existence of God?
*Failed to nourish and protect my faith?
*Rejected everything opposed to a sound faith?
*Deliberately misled others about doctrine or the faith?
*Rejected the Catholic faith, joined another Christian denomination, or joined or practiced another religion?
*Joined a group forbidden to Catholics (Masons, communists, etc.)?
*Despaired about my salvation or the forgiveness of my sins?
*Presumed on God’s mercy? (Committing a sin in expectation of forgiveness, or asking for forgiveness without conversion and practicing virtue.)
*Loved someone or something more than God (money, power, sex, ambition, etc.)?
*Let someone or something influence my choices more than God?
*Engaged in superstitious practices? (Including horoscopes, fortunetellers, etc.)
*Been involved in the occult? (séances, Ouija board, worship of Satan, etc.)
*Formally left the Catholic Church?
*Hidden a serious sin or told a lie in Confession?

Second Commandment

You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain.

Have I…

*Used the name of God in cursing or blasphemy?
*Failed to keep vows or promises that I have made to God?
*Spoken about the Faith, the Church, the saints, or sacred things with irreverence, hatred, or defiance?
*Watched television or movies, or listened to music that treated God, the Church, the saints, or sacred things irreverently?
*Used vulgar, suggestive, or obscene speech?
*Belittled others in my speech?
*Behaved disrespectfully in Church?
*Misused places or things set apart for the worship of God?
*Committed perjury? (Breaking an oath or lying under oath.)
Blamed God for my failings?

Third Commandment

Remember to keep holy the Sabbath day.

Have I…

*Set time aside each day for personal prayer to God?
*Missed Mass on Sunday or Holy Days (through my own fault without sufficient reason)?
*Committed a sacrilege against the Blessed Sacrament?
*Received a sacrament while in the state of mortal sin?
*Habitually came late to and/or left early from Mass without a good reason?
*Shopped, labored, or done business unnecessarily on Sunday or other Holy Days of Obligation?
*Not attended to taking my children to Mass?
*Knowingly eaten meat on a day of penance (or not fasted on a fast day)?
